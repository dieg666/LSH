Be
sober-minded;
be
watchful.
Your
adversary
the
devil
prowls
around
like
a
roaring
lion,
seeking
someone
to
devour.
Whoever
makes
a
practice
of
sinning
is
of
the
devil,
for
the
devil
has
been
sinning
from
the
beginning.
The
reason
the
Son
of
God
appeared
was
to
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil.
And
no
wonder,
for
even
Satan
disguises
himself
as
an
angel
of
light.
You
are
of
your
father
the
devil,
and
your
will
is
to
do
your
father's
desires.
He
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
truth,
because
there
is
no
truth
in
him.
When
he
lies,
he
speaks
out
of
his
own
character,
for
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
lies.
Submit
yourselves
therefore
to
God.
Resist
the
devil,
and
he
will
flee
from
you.
